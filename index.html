            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Joseph Borders. I started coding at around nine years old. Since then I have mostly worked in python, but recently had an introduction into HTML, CSS, and JS. Outside of school, I am a passionate trampoline gymnast. I have completed a couple of times internationally for Team USA. </p>
            <p>I have a strong motivation to learn and hone my skills. I pride myself on my determination and ability to learn fast. I work extremely hard due to my background in gymnastics. I hope to continue coding and one day get into AI with python. In essence, I am a dedicated problem-solver with a drive to learn. I thrive on challenges, and I am committed to continuous growth, both personally and professionally.</p>
